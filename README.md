# NBA Memory Game

NBA Memory Game is a simple card memorization game.  A set of cards with NBA Team logos is generated and the player must sucessfully click all cards without clicking on any of them more than once.

Created for personal educational purposes, to practice React fundamentals like conditional rendering, arrays, hooks, event handlers, and components.

Built with **React+Vite** and **Tailwind**
